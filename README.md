my learning with data science and implementing simple regression model
This piece of code i have posted is how to implement and deploy a simple linear regreson model using r and Azure ML.
The data set used for the same is of around 1034 baseball player with basis details like - Name, Team, Age, Height, Weight,Position.
The r code first read the data then manipulate and clean the dataset accordingly a sper required.
Then the correlation being plotted.
Note: Multiconilinearity has been ignored in this example as the objective is to depict the basic linear model and deploy the same.
AZURE ML provide the webservice method to call the r script where user can provid the Height and Age to get the predicted Weight.
............Thanks to all!!
